My journey to learning software development started years ago, perhaps in an unconventional way, but I have always been one to interpret the world a little bit differently than others. I was not one of those kids who tinkered with computers or took things apart. My story actually started in a college Spanish class. That is when I realized that I loved languages; how there are so many words that represent a single idea or a single thing, how we use different sounds to create words, to express ourselves.

I have studied Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Swedish, and Hebrew. My love for language has now extended into a new world: code. I read an article last year about ‘programming languages’ and decided I would try a few of them out. After trying a few free online courses, I found Learn.co. It has been extremely challenging, yet there is a certain satisfaction that comes with building and breaking programs and getting the reward of seeing your hard work displayed right there on the screen.

For years, I did not know what I wanted, and therefore had jobs that did not present the challenges I was yearning for. With programming, it is a constant challenge and every day is different. I am currently learning Rails and Javascript in the Full Stack Web Development program through Learn.co at Flatiron School. When I first started, I barely knew how to set up a basic HTML header and paragraph (thanks, Geocities). I hope to continue to push myself, to keep learning, to think like a programmer, and to eventually get a job doing what I love!
